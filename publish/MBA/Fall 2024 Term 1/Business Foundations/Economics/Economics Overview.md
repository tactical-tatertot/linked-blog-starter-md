1. **Microeconomics**: Microeconomics focuses on the behavior of individual agents, such as households, firms, and industries, and how their decisions affect the allocation of resources. Key concepts include:
    
    - **Supply and Demand**: The fundamental forces that determine the prices and quantities of goods and services in a market economy. Demand refers to the quantity of a good or service that consumers are willing and able to purchase at various prices, while supply refers to the quantity that producers are willing and able to sell at various prices. The interaction of supply and demand determines the equilibrium price and quantity in a market. [[Supply and Demand]]
